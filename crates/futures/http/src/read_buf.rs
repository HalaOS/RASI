/// A wrapper around a byte buffer that is incrementally filled and initialized.
///
/// This type is a sort of "double cursor". It tracks three regions in the
/// buffer: a region at the beginning of the buffer that has been logically
/// filled with data, a region that has been initialized at some point but not
/// yet logically filled, and a region at the end that may be uninitialized.
/// The filled region is guaranteed to be a subset of the initialized region.
///
/// In summary, the contents of the buffer can be visualized as:
///
/// ```not_rust
/// [             capacity              ]
/// [ filled |         unfilled         ]
/// [    initialized    | uninitialized ]
/// ```
///
/// It is undefined behavior to de-initialize any bytes from the uninitialized
/// region, since it is merely unknown whether this region is uninitialized or
/// not, and if part of it turns out to be initialized, it must stay initialized.
